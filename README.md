# hotel_review_analysis
We have investigated the drivers of positive and negative reviews using NLP, and compared the review's positivity rate in different hotel classes.

Customer Generated Contents have revolutionized the way in which hoteliers measure and evaluate their performance attributes. Astonishingly, 95% of hotel guests now rely on reviews to make their stay decision while 85% of the travellers read up to 10 reviews before making the final booking (Hospitality, 2016). Hospitality professionals, indeed, believe that reviews are rich yet accessible data sources for Natural Language Processing (NLP), Sentiment analysis, and many more state-of-the-art AI and analytics functions. Hence, hotel operators can undoubtedly extract the most relevant analysis and form appropriate strategies to prevent issues and generate better customers' reviews which translate to higher revenue and profit.
As we explored open databases for online hotel reviews, two relevant data sources caught our attention - the first one is the publicly available 515,000 review data from booking.com and the second one is Smith Travel Research's (STR) hotel chain classification. They provide the solid ground for us to define our business problems. First, we investigate the drivers of positive and negative reviews using NLP; then we compare the review's positivity rate in different segments dictated by the STR chain hotel list; and finally, we aim to uncover seasonality in the positivity review score.

Specifically, we aim to provide answers for the 3 business questions below:
1 - What are the keywords that are majorly contained in customer reviews that lead to satisfaction/dissatisfaction based on the 515,000 reviews' positivity rate?
2 - Do the hotels from reputable chains have higher positivity review score? (Segmentation taken from STR chain scales dataset)
3 - Is there any identified seasonal trend in the positivity score?

This notebook is developed for Python 3.7+, and expects a standard Jupyter Hub or Jupyter notebook environment. Moreover, we also provide a Powerpoint presentation with 5 slides highlighting our key findings. This is a group project prepared and delivered in 2 steps (project files are splited accordingly).
